# Skyscrapers and Humans

**Projection Description**
With standard of living rising all over the world and more people moving to cities, buildings are getting taller and taller. Not only do skyscrapers provide retail, office, and living spaces for people, some have even become attractions being known for the height. The U.S has several well-known skyscrapers, but the height is not comparable to others in the world. In addition, studies have shown that skyscrapers can help make cities affordable and greener. This project seeks to answer several main questions about skyscraper and their locations. First part of the project will look at the history of skyscrapers, such as the material and height throughout time. The second will analyze 6 main variables of interest to investigate the relationship between the demographic of a city and the number of skyscrapers. 

**Repository Contents**
The repository contains CSV files of the city census values and skyscraper data. It contains the final project notebook with all the code, a README, and requirements of packages needed to run the project.

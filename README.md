# DH140 Final Project Ideas

**Topics I am currently interested in:**

1. Urbanization and mapping
- I would be interested in possibly mapping demographics using Census data. 
2. Geography and affects on population
- Another interesting topic I have in mind would be finding geography related data sets (such as weather, El Nino, clouds, etc.) and seeing how it interacts and affects the population.

**Ideas from curated datasets & project lists**
1. El Nino
- Ocean and surface spatio-temporal meteorological readings taken from nearly 70 buoys on the Equatorial Pacific Ocean to monitor ENSO. It has wind data, temperature, SST, relative humidity, etc. I can use this data to determine anomalies and interesting weather phenomenons compared to normal conditions.
2. Clouds
- The cloud dataset is grided data of visible and infrared radiation. It will be useful to use with ENSO data, such as SST and temperatures; however, there is a little documentation and it is not normalized.
3. Air Quality
- Dataset is collected from an Italian field from Mar 2004 to Feb 2005. The data contains hourly averages for 5 main chemicals: CO, non-metal hydrocarbons, benzene, NOx, and NO2. It will be interesting to use this data to investigate seasonal differences in air quality and chemical compositions.
